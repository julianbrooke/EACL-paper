"which is" unchanged, as part of direct quote

== page 2

"distinguish" is unchanged as the subject is plural (Schneider et al.)

== page 6

"independent FS do not" -- "FS" is used as a shorthand for "formulaic
sequences" (plural) throughout, so this is consistent with usage elsewhere;
the same applies for another suggested edit later ("FS do", "FS ... seem")

== page 8

"hard covering" refers to a process, and is hence a generic noun, making "a"
inappropriate; this usage is consistent throughout the paper

The use of the past tense in "Lemmatization included" is consistent with the
remainder of that paragraph, so unchanged

"many elements ... are segmented into independent morphological units" --
adding a comma before "are" creates an awkward discontinuity, so unchanged

== page 9

"three native-speaker, educated annotators" -- here "native-speaker" is a
pre-modifier of "annotators" and thus singular

"regards to annotation" -- "annotation" is a process here, so hence generic
making "an" inappropriate; given this generic usage, "regards" sounds better
than "regard" to our collective ear, so unchanged
