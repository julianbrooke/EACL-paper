  abstract = {E-rater has been used by the Educational Testing Service for automated essay scoring since 1999. This paper describes a new version of e-rater (V.2) that is different from other automated essay scoring systems in several important respects. The main innovations of e-rater V.2 are a small, intuitive, and meaningful set of features used for scoring; a single scoring model and standards can be used across all prompts of an assessment; modeling procedures that are transparent and flexible, and can be based entirely on expert judgment. The paper describes this new system and presents evidence on the validity and reliability of its scores.}

Data analyzed in the study were holistic and multi-trait essay scores provided by human raters and essay feature variable scores computed by e-rater(R) (version 2.0) for two TOEFL CBT writing prompts. It was found that (i) all of the six multi-trait scores were not only correlated among themselves but also correlated with the holistic score, (ii) high correlations obtained among holistic and multi-trait scores were largely attributable to the impact of essay length on both holistic and multi-trait scoring, and (iii) some strong associations were confirmed between several e-rater variables and multi-trait rating dimensions. Implications are discussed for improving the multi-trait scoring of essays, refining e-rater essay feature variables, and validating automated essay scores.

  year = "1993",

  abstract = "<P>
              The problem of style is highly relevant to computational linguistics, but
              current systems deal only superficially, if at all, with subtle but
              significant nuances of language.  Expressive effects, together with their
              associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis
              and absent from generation.</p>
              <P>
              We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that
              is intended to eventually incorporate three selected components---lexical,
              syntactic, and semantic.  In this paper, we concentrate on certain aspects
              of syntactic style.  We have designed and implemented a computational
              theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various
              applications, including machine translation, second-language instruction,
              and natural language generation.</p>
              <P>
              We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and
              abstract elements of style.  The primitive elements describe the stylistic
              effects of individual sentence components.  These elements are combined
              into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the abstract
              elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects
              common to a group of sentences.  Higher-level patterns are built from the
              abstract elements and associated with specific stylistic goals, such as
              clarity or concreteness.  Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic
              stylistic grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive
              elements, abstract elements, and stylistic goals.  Grammars for both
              English and French have been constructed, using the same vocabulary and the
              same development methodology.  Parsers that implement these grammars have
              also been built.</p>
              <P>
              The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously
              defined only descriptively.  The theory is being applied to various
              problems in which the form of an utterance conveys an essential part of
              meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood.</p>",

   abstract = "Often, a text that has been written collaboratively does not ``speak
                with a single voice.''  Such a text is stylistically incongruous --- as
                opposed to merely stylistically inconsistent, which might or might not
                be deleterious to the quality of the text.  This widespread problem
                reduces the overall quality of a text and reflects poorly on its
                authors.  We would like to design a facility for revising style that
                augments the software environments in which collaborative writing takes
                place, but before doing so, a question must be answered: what is the
                role of subjectivity in stylistic assessment for a style-revision
                facility?  We describe an experiment designed to measure the agreement
                between the stylistic assessments performed by a group of subjects,
                based on a free-sort of writing samples.  The results show that there
                is a statistically significant level of agreement between the subjects'
                assessments and, furthermore, there was a small number of groupings
                (three) of even more similar stylistic assessments.  The results also
                show the invalidity of using authorship as an indicator of the reader's
                perceptions of stylistic similarity between the writing samples.",

  abstract = "<P>When two or more writers collaborate on a document by each
              contributing pieces of text, the problem can arise that while each
              might be an exemplary piece of writing, they do not cohere into a
              document that speaks with a single voice.  That is, they are
              <B>stylistically inconsistent</B>.  But given a stylistically
              inconsistent document, people often find it hard to articulate exactly
              where the problems lie.  Rather, they feel that something is wrong,
              but can't quite say why.</p>
              <P>An example of stylistic inconsistency can be seen in the following
              sentence, which is from a brochure given to hospital patients who are
              to undergo a cardiac catheterization.  (The parenthesized numbers are
              ours, to refer to the individual clauses.)</p>
              <BLOCKQUOTE>
                  <P>(1) Once the determination for a cardiac catheterization
                  has been made, (2) various tests will need to be performed
                  (3) to properly assess your condition prior to the procedure.
              </BLOCKQUOTE>
              <P>Clause 1 and (to a slightly lesser extent) clause 3 are in medical
              talk, as if in a formal communication from physician to physician;
              clause 2 is much more informal, and is expressed in ordinary lay
              language.  The effect of the two styles mixed together in the one
              sentence is a feeling of incongruity---which was presumably not
              intended by the author or authors.  This example, however, is unusual
              in its brevity.  More often, the problem of inconsistency emerges only
              over longer stretches of text, especially where the granularity of the
              multiple authorship is at the paragraph, section, or chapter level.
              Moreover, while stylistic inconsistencies arise primarily in jointly
              written documents, we do not exclude the possibility of their
              occurrence in singly authored texts, especially those where different
              parts were written at different times or, initially, for different
              purposes.</p>
              <P> Our ultimate goal in this research is to build software that will
              help with this problem---that will point out stylistic inconsistencies
              in a document, and perhaps suggest how they can be fixed.  In this
              paper, we report some of our initial explorations and data collection.</p>",

  abstract = "<P>
              This article describes an intelligent computer-assisted language
              instruction system that is designed to teach principles of syntactic style
              to students of English.  Unlike conventional style checkers, the system
              performs a complete syntactic analysis of its input, and takes the
              student's stylistic intent into account when providing a diagnosis.  Named
              STASEL, for Stylistic Treatment At the Sentence Level, the system is
              specifically developed for the teaching of style, and makes use of
              artificial intelligence techniques in natural language processing to
              analyze free-form input sentences interactively.</p>
              <P>
              An important contribution of STASEL is its ability to provide stylistic
              guidance according to the specific writing goals of clarity and
              conciseness.  In an attempt to remedy some of the deficiencies of existing
              instructional software, STASEL's design demonstrates how stylistic
              instruction can be effectively computerized, while laying the groundwork
              for the creation of intelligent tutoring systems for teaching writing.</p>"

  abstract = "<P>
              We develop a new computational model for representing the fine-grained
              meanings of near-synonyms and the differences between them. We also
              develop a sophisticated lexical-choice process that can decide which
              of several near-synonyms is most appropriate in a particular
              situation. This research has direct applications in machine
              translation and text generation.</p>
              <P>We first identify the problems of representing near-synonyms in a
              computational lexicon and show that no previous model adequately
              accounts for near-synonymy. We then propose a preliminary theory to
              account for near-synonymy, relying crucially on the notion of
              granularity of representation, in which the meaning of a word arises
              out of a context-dependent combination of a context-independent core
              meaning and a set of explicit differences to its near-synonyms. That
              is, near-synonyms cluster together.</p>
              <P>We then develop a clustered model of lexical knowledge, derived from
              the conventional ontological model. The model cuts off the ontology at
              a coarse grain, thus avoiding an awkward proliferation of
              language-dependent concepts in the ontology, and groups near-synonyms
              into subconceptual clusters that are linked to the ontology. A cluster
              differentiates near-synonyms in terms of fine-grained aspects of
              denotation, implication, expressed attitude, and style. The model is
              general enough to account for other types of variation, for instance,
              in collocational behaviour.</p>
              <P>An efficient, robust, and flexible fine-grained lexical-choice process
              is a consequence of a clustered model of lexical knowledge.  To make
              it work, we formalize criteria for lexical choice as preferences to
              express certain concepts with varying indirectness, to express
              attitudes, and to establish certain styles.  The lexical-choice
              process itself works on two tiers: between clusters and between
              near-synonyns of clusters. We describe our prototype implementation of
              the system, called I-Saurus.</p>",
